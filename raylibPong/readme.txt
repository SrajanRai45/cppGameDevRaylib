this project was made using a template provided by "Programming with Nick"
this project was made using a turtorial by the same , there are some differences in code as I wrote it but its similar to the source one

thanks to "Programming With Nick" for providing such a good turtorial which covers most of the aspects of 2D game dev with raylib 
except:- collision engine , physics engine , lighting solutions , shaders
